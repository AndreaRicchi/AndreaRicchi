### Hi there, Andrea here ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer with a strong passion for all areas of technology, particularly embedded systems. I'm committed to continuous learning, regularly exploring new programming languages and emerging technologies to deepen my understanding of computer science and low-level development. I actively contribute to open-source projects and strongly believe in the open-source philosophy, collaboration, transparency, and shared growth as a driving force for innovation and community building.
